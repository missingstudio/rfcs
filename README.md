## AI Studio RFCs
The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for changes to AI studio (such as new features) so that all stakeholders can be confident about the direction of the project.

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.

Some changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put through a bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the AI studio community and team.
